"""Write a program that asks how much study benefits the user receives and calculates how a 1,17 percent index raise affects the benefits. The program prints the following:

Enter the amount of the study benefits: 335.32
If the index raise is 1.17 percent, the study benefit,
after a raise, would be 339.243244 euros

Letâ€™s be optimistic about the future and add another index raise to our program. Now the program prints the following:

Enter the amount of the study benefits: 335.32
If the index raise is 1.17 percent, the study benefit,
after a raise, would be 339.243244 euros
and if there was another index raise, the study
benefits would be as much as 343.2123899548 euros
